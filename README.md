DeviceModel
===========

Newest DeviceModel.  This is a java tool to build a library for restful interfaces to make hardware models.  It is a collaboration of multiple people including Frank, Adam, Pobzeb, and myself just hosted on my account for now.  It requires gson-2.2.4.jar and jdom2-2.0.5.jar to run.
